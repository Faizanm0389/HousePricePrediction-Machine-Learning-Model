# HousePricePrediction-Machine-Learning-Model
This Jupyter Notebook explores and analyzes a dataset containing information about properties in Ontario, Canada. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnabaee/ontarioproperties?resource=download), includes 25,351 rows of data, covering key details such as Address, AreaName, Prices, Latitude, and Longitude.

## Features:

Address: The physical address of the property.
AreaName: The area or neighborhood in Ontario where the property is located.
Prices: The price of the property in dollars.
Latitude: The latitude coordinates of the property.
Longitude: The longitude coordinates of the property.
Analysis Highlights:

Data Exploration: Investigate the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.
Geospatial Analysis: Visualize property locations on a map using latitude and longitude.
Price Analysis: Explore price trends and variations across different areas in Ontario.
Statistical Modeling: Implement machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to predict property prices based on location coordinates.

## Comparative Modeling:
Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest machine learning models were implemented and compared to discern their effectiveness in predicting property prices based on location coordinates.
